## 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Redirect chain detection** — real-time detection of affiliate hijacking (unknown -> attribution -> deep link pattern within 3s); auto-blocks trigger domains and logs security events
- **Blocked services: Tracking & Redirects** — 3 new toggleable services: Affiliate Redirects (onelink.me, adjust.com, branch.io, etc.), Ad Trackers (pangle.io, criteo, taboola, etc.), Piracy File Hosts (downloadwella.com, mixdrop, streamtape, etc.); auto-enabled on startup
- **14 default blocklist sources** — built-in feeds for ads, trackers, popups, phishing, scam, adult content, Samsung/Xiaomi/TikTok native trackers (Hagezi, ShadowWhisperer, curbengh, BlockListProject); shown with `default` badge in UI, cannot be removed
- **AdBlock format parsing** — updater now supports `||domain^` format in addition to hosts and plain domain lists
- **Stale source auto-disable** — sources unchanged for N days (configurable 30-365, default 90) auto-disabled; 3+ consecutive fetch failures also auto-disable
- **Blocklist update progress bar** — real-time progress (fetching N/M sources, writing DB, indexing, finalizing) with `/api/updater/progress` endpoint polled every 2s
- **130+ privacy report company mappings** — covers Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, ByteDance, Samsung, Xiaomi, Shopee, Tencent, Cloudflare, Akamai, Brave, Reddit, DuckDuckGo, GCash, Maya, Atlassian, and many more; unmatched domains show parent domain instead of generic "Other"
- **Tab persistence** — active dashboard tab saved in URL hash; browser refresh stays on current tab
- **Custom modal dialogs** — dark-themed confirm/prompt dialogs replace all 7 native browser dialogs
- **Login rate limiting** — 5 failed attempts per IP in 5-minute window, then locked out; applies to both web form and `/api/auth/login` (returns 429)
- **Configurable digest frequency** — weekly/monthly/yearly email digest replaces daily; configurable day-of-week, day-of-month, and hour

### Fixed
- **Starlette 1.0.0 breaking change** — updated all 8 TemplateResponse calls to new `(request, name, context=)` signature; pinned FastAPI <1.0 and uvicorn <1.0 in Dockerfile
- **Blocked queries excluded from rate/burst counters** — ad SDK bursts (AppsFlyer, Pangle, inner-active) no longer penalize legitimate DNS from the same device
- **Windows "No Internet" status** — removed Windows NCSI domains (msftconnecttest.com, msftncsi.com, ipv6.msftconnecttest.com) from captive portal redirect
- **Device fingerprint accuracy** — removed connectivitycheck.gstatic.com from Android signals (Chrome on any OS queries it); boosted Windows-exclusive and Android-exclusive signal weights
- **Digest re-send on restart** — `_last_digest_sent` now initializes to today's date on startup

### Changed
- `/health` returns only `{"status":"ok"}` to unauthenticated requests; full breakdown requires auth
- `/metrics` removed from public paths — now requires authentication
- Health check error messages sanitized (no exception details exposed)
- Blocklist sources split into default (hardcoded in `default_sources.py`) and user-added (in `sources.yml`)
